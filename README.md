# Safeguarding-of-crops-from-animals-using-CNN-
This project addresses the problem of crop damage due to animal intrusion with a smart and humane solution. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images, the system distinguishes between domestic and wild animals. A dataset of 10,000 images ensures robust training, resulting in a 95% classification accuracy.
