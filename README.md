Crop damage due to animal intrusion is a significant problem faced by farmers worldwide. Traditional solutions, such as wire and electric fences, can harm animals and pose fire hazards if not properly maintained. This project provides a smart and humane solution to mitigate economic losses for farmers and enhance crop yield.
The system employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images captured during an animal intrusion, distinguishing between domestic and wild animals. The dataset used for training and testing consists of 10,000 images of various animals, with an even distribution between domestic and wild categories. The model achieved an accuracy of 95% in correctly classifying the animals. When a wild animal is detected, the system sends an SMS alert to the farmer via Twilio, allowing for prompt action.
Additionally, a web application was developed to provide an interface for monitoring and managing alerts. This smart farm protection system ensures the safety and security of crops while preserving animal welfare. By leveraging advanced image classification, real-time alerts, and an intuitive web interface, this solution offers a reliable and efficient alternative to conventional fencing methods, reducing manual labor and enhancing farm management.
